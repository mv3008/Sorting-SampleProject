# Sorting-SampleProject
Analyze Sorting - Bubble, Selection, Insertion your self..How it works..

This sample code will help you experience how these basic sorting works..This sample is a C# console application and has implementation
for 3 types of sortings - Bubble, Selection, Insertion..

It gives more insights and understanding beyond theory :

1. How the Algo works?
2. In how many passes your data will be sorted?
3. Number of comparisons made?
4. Number of swaps made?..etc

This is a very early implementation and may be beneficial for beginners.
I have taken array as a storage...Will release more options later...

So Start cloning and learn yourself..

Thanks
